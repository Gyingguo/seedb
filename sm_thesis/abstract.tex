%% The text of your abstract and nothing else (other than comments) goes here.
%% It will be single-spaced and the rest of the text that is supposed to go on
%% the abstract page will be generated by the abstractpage environment.  This

Data analysts operating on large volumes of data 
often rely on visualizations to interpret the results of queries. 
However, finding the right visualization for a query is 
a laborious and time-consuming task. 
We propose \SeeDB, a system that partially automates 
this task:  given a query, \SeeDB\ explores the space of all possible
visualizations, and automatically identifies and recommends to the analyst those visualizations
it finds to be most ``interesting'' or ``useful''.
