\chapter{Modeling Combination Quality}

A significant contribution of this work is building an accurate and extensible
model that can predict the quality of combinations. The model must be accurate
in order to correctly predict combination quality; however, the model must also
be extensible so that (a) new training data can be easily added, (b) new
features can be easily added, (c) new heuristics can be easily added.

\section{Features}

Table XXX shows the features used for individual clothing items, item pairs and
combinations of items. Generation of these features was discussed in Section
XXX.
