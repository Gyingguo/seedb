\chapter{Conclusion}

In this thesis, we described a prototype of the \SeeDB\ system used to find
interesting visualizations of any database query. Given a query Q, \SeeDB\
identifies and highlights the top-k most interesting views of Q using techniques
based on deviation. We implement \SeeDB\ as a layer on top of a relational DBMS
and describe the various optimizations strategies used to provide
near-interactive response times for a range of datasets. Our experimental
evaluation demonstrates the benefits of each of the different optimizations. We
build a model to predict the performance of \SeeDB\ as a function of \SeeDB\
and the DBMS parameters. We then use this model to pick optimal
parameters for \SeeDB\ over a range of diverse datasets. Finally, we
demonstrate that the combination of \SeeDB\ optimizations offers almost a 100X
speedup in total execution time and allows automatic visualization to be
performed in an interactive manner.
