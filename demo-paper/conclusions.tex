\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}
\noindent We outlined our vision for \SeeDB: a system that provides analysts
with visualizations highlighting interesting aspects of the query result. We
defined several concrete problems in architecting \SeeDB, relating to areas
ranging from multi-query optimization and approximation to multi-criteria
optimization. We believe that the general area of bringing visualizations closer
to the DBMS is a challenging, yet, important direction for database research in
the future.
