Data analysts operating on large volumes of data 
often rely on visualizations to interpret the results of queries. 
However, finding the right visualization for a query is 
a laborious and time-consuming task. 
We propose \SeeDB, a system that partially automates 
this task: 
given a query, \SeeDB\ explores the space of all possible visualizations,
and automatically identifies and recommends to the analyst those visualizations
it finds to be most ``interesting'' or ``useful''.
