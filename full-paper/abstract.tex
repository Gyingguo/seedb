Data scientists analyzing large amounts of data often rely on visualizations to
identify interesting trends and gain insights. However, picking the right
visualization is a manual and tedious task. Given a query, the analyst would
like to know what makes the results of a query ``interesting'' compared to the
underlying dataset. In this paper, we demonstrate a prototype of \SeeDB\, a
system that automatically discovers differences in trends between a query and
the underlying dataset, and visualizes the differences to help data analysis.
