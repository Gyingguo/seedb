Data analysts operating on large volumes of data often rely on visualizations to
interpret the results of queries.
However, finding the right visualization for a query is a laborious and
time-consuming task.
We propose \SeeDB, a system to partially automate this task:
given a query, \SeeDB\ intelligently explores the space of all possible
visualizations, evaluates promising visualizations, and automatically identifies
and recommends to the analyst the most ``interesting'' or ``useful''
visualizations. 
In this paper, we present multiple implementations of \SeeDB,
both on top of existing database systems and as a stand alone in-memory
solution. 
For each implementation, we develop and evaluate a suite of
optimizations that leverage the underlying system implementations. 
Our
experiments  on a range of real world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that
our optimizations speed up processing by upto XXX\% and do not sacrificing
accuracy in case of heuristics. 
Our end-to-end experiments also demonstrate that
that \SeeDB\ can be used to find interesting visualizations in interactive
times. 
Finally, we present the results of a user study that evaluates our method
for interesting visualizations, the relative quality of different distance
metrics and the \SeeDB\ system.
