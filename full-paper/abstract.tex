Data analysts operating on large volumes of data 
often rely on visualizations to interpret the results of queries. 
However, finding the right visualization for a query is 
a laborious and time-consuming task. 
We propose \SeeDB, a system that partially automates 
this task: 
given a query, \SeeDB\ explores the space of all possible visualizations,
and automatically identifies and recommends to the analyst those visualizations
it finds to be most ``interesting'' or ``useful''.

\SeeDB\ takes advantage of current state-of-the-art research in database systems, query optimization, statistical analysis, and data visualization to simplify and guide analysts through the process of visually identifying interesting trends in the data. Little work has been done in the research community to automate this process. \SeeDB\ aims to be a portable, time-saving, and effective tool to be included in a data analyst's toolkit.
